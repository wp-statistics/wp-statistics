# WP Statistics React Environment Configuration
#
# SETUP: Copy this file to .env.react and modify as needed:
#   cp .env.react.example .env.react
#
# For local overrides, create .env.react.local (gitignored)

# Node environment (development/production)
NODE_ENV=development

# Vite dev server URL (required for React dev mode)
#
# IMPORTANT: Set this to your WordPress site URL
# - The Vite dev server will run on port 5173 (or port from URL if specified)
# - The origin/domain must match your WordPress site for CORS
#
# Examples:
#   - Laravel Valet:     https://wordpress.test
#   - MAMP (port 8888):  http://localhost:8888
#   - Local WP:          http://localhost
#   - Custom port:       http://localhost:3000
#
# Default for traditional localhost setup:
VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost
#
# For Laravel Valet (change domain as needed):
# VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=https://wordpress.test
